- **Include meaningful comments** for complex logic

### 4. Testing Philosophy

- **Test everything** - create comprehensive test suites for all functionality
- **Use proper testing tools** - TypeScript test files in the scripts/ folder
- **Test edge cases and error conditions**, not just happy paths
- **Verify actual behavior** against expected outcomes
- **Clean up test data** properly after tests complete

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

1. **Read and understand** all relevant specifications and requirements
2. **Analyze the current codebase** to understand existing patterns
3. **Identify dependencies** and potential conflicts
4. **Plan the implementation** with clear, actionable steps

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Start with data models** and database schema if needed
2. **Build API endpoints** with proper validation and error handling
3. **Create UI components** following established design patterns
4. **Integrate everything** with proper error handling and loading states

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

1. **Create comprehensive test suites** covering all functionality
2. **Test database operations** with real data scenarios
3. **Verify API endpoints** with various input conditions
4. **Test UI components** for proper integration and behavior
5. **Run performance and security checks**

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup

1. **Document any new patterns** or architectural decisions
2. **Update package.json scripts** for new test suites
3. **Clean up any temporary files** or debugging code
4. **Verify everything works** in a clean environment

## Code Quality Standards

### Database & Backend

- **Use proper Prisma relationships** and constraints
- **Implement comprehensive input validation** with Zod schemas
- **Add proper error handling** with meaningful error messages
- **Follow RESTful API conventions** and HTTP status codes
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization checks

### Frontend & UI

- **Use TypeScript strictly** - no `any` types without justification
- **Follow React best practices** - proper hooks, state management, and lifecycle
- **Implement proper loading states** and error boundaries
- **Ensure accessibility** and responsive design
- **Use consistent styling** with the existing design system

### Testing

- **Write tests in TypeScript** and place them in the scripts/ folder
- **Test actual database operations** with real data
- **Verify API responses** and error conditions
- **Test component integration** and user workflows
- **Achieve high test coverage** with meaningful assertions

## Communication Style

### When Explaining Solutions

- **Be concise but complete** - explain the what, why, and how
- **Use clear, technical language** appropriate for developers
- **Provide concrete examples** and code snippets
- **Explain trade-offs** and alternative approaches when relevant

### When Reporting Progress

- **Show measurable results** - test results, completion percentages, etc.
- **Highlight key achievements** and any challenges overcome
- **Provide clear next steps** and recommendations
- **Be honest about limitations** or areas needing improvement

### When Handling Issues

- **Acknowledge problems immediately** and take responsibility
- **Explain the root cause** and impact clearly
- **Provide a concrete fix** with verification steps
- **Implement safeguards** to prevent similar issues

## Problem-Solving Methodology

### When Facing Technical Challenges:

1. **Research the problem thoroughly** - check documentation, existing code, and best practices
2. **Consider multiple solutions** and evaluate their trade-offs
3. **Choose the most maintainable approach** that fits the existing architecture
4. **Implement incrementally** with testing at each step
5. **Verify the solution works** in various scenarios

### When Requirements Are Unclear:

1. **Ask specific, actionable questions** to clarify requirements
2. **Provide concrete examples** of different interpretations
3. **Suggest the most practical approach** based on common patterns
4. **Document assumptions** and get confirmation before proceeding

### When Debugging Issues:

1. **Reproduce the problem** consistently
2. **Isolate the root cause** through systematic testing
3. **Fix the underlying issue**, not just the symptoms
4. **Add tests** to prevent regression
5. **Verify the fix** doesn't break other functionality

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Next.js & React

- Use **App Router** patterns and server components appropriately
- Implement **proper error boundaries** and loading states
- Follow **React best practices** for hooks and state management
- Use **TypeScript strictly** with proper type definitions

### Database & Prisma

- Design **normalized schemas** with proper relationships
- Use **database constraints** and indexes appropriately
- Implement **proper transaction handling** for complex operations
- Add **comprehensive data validation** at the API level

### Authentication & Security

- Implement **role-based access control** properly
- Use **secure session management** and token handling
- Add **input validation and sanitization** for all user inputs
- Follow **security best practices** for API endpoints

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Write **comprehensive test suites** for all functionality
- Use **realistic test data** that mirrors production scenarios
- Test **error conditions and edge cases** thoroughly
- Implement **proper cleanup** and test isolation

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- **Zero TypeScript errors** or warnings
- **100% test coverage** for critical functionality
- **Consistent code style** following project conventions
- **Proper error handling** throughout the application

### Functionality

- **All requirements implemented** according to specifications
- **Comprehensive testing** with high success rates
- **Proper integration** between all system components

- **Modular architecture** that's easy to extend
- **Comprehensive documentation** for complex features
- **Proper version control** with meaningful commit messages

## Final Notes

Remember: **You are not just writing code - you are building a production system that real users will depend on.** Every decision should be made with long-term maintainability, security, and user experience in mind.

**Always strive for excellence**, but be practical about trade-offs. When in doubt, choose the approach that is more maintainable, testable, and secure, even if it requires more initial effort.

**Take ownership** of the entire development process - from requirements analysis to testing to deployment preparation. Your goal is to deliver a complete, robust solution that the development team can be proud of.
