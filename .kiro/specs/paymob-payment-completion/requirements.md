# PayMob Payment Completion Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of the PayMob payment integration by implementing proper callback handling, payment verification, and automatic course enrollment upon successful payment. The current implementation successfully initiates payments and redirects users to PayMob, but lacks the callback handling to complete the payment flow and enroll students in courses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Payment Callback Handling

**User Story:** As a student who has completed payment on PayMob, I want the system to automatically process my payment and enroll me in the course so that I can immediately access the course content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes payment on PayMob THEN the system SHALL receive and process the payment callback
2. WHEN PayMob sends a webhook notification THEN the system SHALL verify the payment signature using HMAC
3. WHEN the payment signature is valid THEN the system SHALL update the payment status in the database
4. WHEN the payment is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically enroll the student in the course
5. WHEN the payment fails THEN the system SHALL update the payment status to failed and notify the student

### Requirement 2: Payment Status Verification

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see the real-time status of my payment so that I know whether my payment was successful or if there are any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student is redirected back from PayMob THEN the system SHALL check the payment status
2. WHEN the payment is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect to the course
3. WHEN the payment is pending THEN the system SHALL display a pending message with instructions
4. WHEN the payment fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry options
5. WHEN checking payment status THEN the system SHALL query both the database and PayMob API for verification

### Requirement 3: Automatic Course Enrollment

**User Story:** As a student who has successfully paid for a course, I want to be automatically enrolled so that I can immediately start learning without additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is confirmed as successful THEN the system SHALL create an enrollment record
2. WHEN creating enrollment THEN the system SHALL set the enrollment date to the payment completion time
3. WHEN enrollment is created THEN the system SHALL update the course enrollment count
4. WHEN enrollment is successful THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the student
5. WHEN enrollment fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and allow manual enrollment by admin

### Requirement 4: Payment Return URL Handling

**User Story:** As a student, I want to be redirected back to the appropriate page after completing payment so that I have a clear next step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes payment THEN PayMob SHALL redirect them to a payment result page
2. WHEN the payment result page loads THEN the system SHALL display the payment status
3. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a link to access the course
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL provide options to retry or contact support
5. WHEN payment is pending THEN the system SHALL explain the next steps and expected timeline

### Requirement 5: Payment Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all payment callbacks to be properly validated to ensure security and prevent fraudulent transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a payment webhook THEN the system SHALL validate the HMAC signature
2. WHEN the signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the webhook and log the attempt
3. WHEN validating payment data THEN the system SHALL check amount, currency, and order details match
4. WHEN payment data doesn't match THEN the system SHALL mark the payment as suspicious and require manual review
5. WHEN processing webhooks THEN the system SHALL implement idempotency to prevent duplicate processing

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a student, I want clear information about any payment issues and options to resolve them so that I can successfully complete my course purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment webhook fails to process THEN the system SHALL retry processing up to 3 times
2. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify administrators
3. WHEN a student's payment is stuck in pending status THEN the system SHALL provide manual verification options
4. WHEN payment verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and next steps
5. WHEN technical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle them without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 7: Payment History and Tracking

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my payment history and transaction details so that I can track my purchases and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student views their profile THEN they SHALL see a list of all their payments
2. WHEN viewing payment history THEN each payment SHALL show status, amount, date, and course details
3. WHEN a payment is pending THEN the student SHALL see estimated completion time
4. WHEN a payment fails THEN the student SHALL see the failure reason and retry options
5. WHEN viewing payment details THEN the student SHALL see the PayMob transaction ID for reference

### Requirement 8: Administrative Payment Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage and monitor all payments in the system so that I can resolve issues and ensure proper financial tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views the payments dashboard THEN they SHALL see all payments with their current status
2. WHEN filtering payments THEN admins SHALL be able to filter by status, date, amount, and course
3. WHEN a payment requires manual intervention THEN admins SHALL be able to manually verify and process it
4. WHEN viewing payment details THEN admins SHALL see all PayMob transaction data and webhook history
5. WHEN processing refunds THEN admins SHALL be able to initiate refunds through the PayMob API
