# UI/UX Modernization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive modernization of the Arabic-first course selling platform's user interface and user experience. Based on thorough analysis of the current codebase (Next.js 15.4.5, React 19.1.1, Tailwind CSS 4.1.11, Shadcn/UI) and inspiration from modern platforms like peec.ai, promptwatch.com, klasio.com, and khaled-sakr.com, this modernization will transform the platform into a cutting-edge, gamified, and highly performant educational platform.

The current platform has 384 TypeScript/React files with basic Shadcn components, limited animations, generic Arabic typography, and outdated UX patterns. This modernization will create a premium educational experience that generates significant revenue through enhanced user engagement and conversion rates.
